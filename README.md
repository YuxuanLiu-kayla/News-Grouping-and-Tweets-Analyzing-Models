# News Grouping and Tweets Analyzing Models

This is a project that takes two raw datasets (20 news groups dataset from scikit learn, and a sentiment140 dataset that contains over 1,600,000 tweets and their corresponding labels) to train several important machine learning models, and predict the news category (or tweet label) of some unknown given tests. The related code can be found in code.ipynb, and the final writeup containing our findings and exploration can be found in writeup.pdf

This is a project of COMP551 (Winter 2022) at McGill University taught by Professor Reihaneh Rabbany. The contributors of this project are: Kaicheng Yan, Junxiang Mao, and Yuxuan Liu (me). The breakdown of workload and contributions can be found at the last section of writeup.pdf.
